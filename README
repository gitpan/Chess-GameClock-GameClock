Chess-GameClock-GameClock
GameClock  release 1.0 

This package is used to build a clock for playing Chess or GO
using the mouse buttons of a laptop as clock buttons. Keyboard
is also separated into two sides, so keys could be used instead 
mouse.
(This release has been tested with Perl 5.8.10 and 5.8.8 with
windows XP.)
In eg there is also an example, ready to use for gameclock:testPack.pl.

The README is used to introduce the module and provide instructions on
how to install the module, any machine dependencies it may have (for
example C compilers and installed libraries) and any other information
that should be provided before the module is installed.

A README file is required for CPAN modules since CPAN extracts the README
file from a module distribution so that people browsing the archive
can use it to get an idea of the module's uses. It is usually a good idea
to provide version information here so that people can decide whether
fixes for the module are worth downloading.
